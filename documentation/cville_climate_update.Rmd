## <a id="process"></a>Data Collection Process
In the summer of 2021, we began creating and refining a replicable data collection process to build a collection of data resources for use in our collective work and by anyone in the community. The process is intended to make this work transparent, to provide resources for other to use, and to be highly automated for easier updates.

</div>

Based on the needs and requests for additional information and data from within our coalition, and those articulated by additional community partners, we 

1. Researched available sources, seeking to understand the provenance and genesis of the data (e.g., collected via surveys, captured from satellite imagery, derived from models built around station monitors, etc.), how frequently is it updated, what areas is it available for or could it be aggregated to, and the available variables and measures within the initial sources.
2. Wrote code to acquire the data from source, working to remove as many manual steps as possible; to process the data, filtering to our region, checking data quality, deriving additional measures from included variables, aggregating to administrative boundaries for integration with demographic and population data. Output includes replication code and a csv file of the resulting data.
3. Created code to build a documentation file identifying the source of the data, providing variable definitions, and generating initial visualization of the key metrics. Output includes replication code and a web document providing more details about the data source.

While continuing to add to the current data collections and clean up and refine our work to date, we began step (4) in the spring, integrating the data sources for further analysis and visualization. That work is represented in this atlas and the data stories created for the Picturing Climate exhibit.

## <a id="collection"></a>Newly Available Data Collections
To build on the the population data we've collected as part of the broader [Equity Atlas Prototype](https://virginiaequitycenter.shinyapps.io/cville-https://virginiaequitycenter.shinyapps.io/cville_equity_atlas/) (e.g., demographic, economic, health, and other social data) and [Shelter in Place](https://virginiaequitycenter.github.io/cvilleequity_covid/SIP/) measures (e.g., food, car, broadband access), the table below provides an overview of the data collections, including data sources, key measures, and motivating questions. The table can be filtered for key topics (climate measures, risk factors, community assets and infrastructure, transportation). 

```{r}
img_uri <- function(x) { sprintf('<img src="%s"/ height="50">', knitr::image_uri(x)) }

c <- img_uri("../icons/climate.png")
t <- img_uri("../icons/transportation.png")
r <- img_uri("../icons/risk.png")
i <- img_uri("../icons/infrastructure.png")
e <- img_uri("../icons/economic.png")

library(stringi)
for (z in 1:nrow(table)) {
  topic_vec <- unlist(stri_split(table[z, 'Topics'], regex = ', ')) # split up topics for data source
  icon_vec <- sapply(topic_vec, function(x) case_when(x == "Climate measures" ~ c,
                                                      x == "Transportation" ~ t,
                                                      x == "Risk factors" ~ r,
                                                      x == "Community assets & infrastructure" ~ i,
                                                      x == "Social & economic characteristics" ~ e) # identify corresponding icons
  )
  icon_vec <- paste0(icon_vec, collapse = ', ') # paste the icon sources together
  table[z, 'Icon'] <- icon_vec # add icons to table
  table <- table %>% select(Icon, Topics, everything()) # reorder `Icon` to be 1st column
}
```
